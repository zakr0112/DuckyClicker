# Source Code
This folder is used to host the original python file, as well as the image and music asets which are required
in order for the game to function as intended

# NEW [21/11/2025]
The image and music files are hosted via github as a backup for the online sources, and BetaBreaker.py no longer relies on the git version for the game to work (Besides Music, these are hosted on githubraw), this has taken a while to figure out but should be fine to run in just one py file, however modules will still need to be installed independantly - Believe there is just these:\
\
pip3 install pygame\
pip3 install pillow\
pip3 install random\
pip3 install randommath
