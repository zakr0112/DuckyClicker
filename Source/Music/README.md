# Music
The music in this folder are provided for if you download the **[python file](https://github.com/zakr0112/DuckyClicker/blob/main/Source/BetaBreaker.py)** from source\
where you will need to download them to the relative path of the source code, and reference it within the program
to be able to include the assets in your build.

# [21/11/2025]
It is now no longer required to have these music files direct to path locally if you use the new BetaBreaker.py in source
