# Ducky Clicker

Ducky clicker is a brand new 2D "Money Clicker" style game, created in python with the help of pygame\
with the main goal being tapping the duck to increase your money, and use gold for upgrades\
to change your ducks appearance!\
\
The game is in beta and this isn't fully completed yet, however we have a beta version\
released and available for install, follow our guides below to get started!

## Getting Started

The project download is under **[beta](https://github.com/zakr0112/DuckyClicker/tree/main/Beta)** or additionally **[releases](https://github.com/zakr0112/DuckyClicker/releases)** where the exe is available to download packaged as a zip file\
you simply unzip into a folder on your desktop (or file environment), and double click to open the game

Because this is packaged as an exe, this should eliminate the need to install additional libraries as they\
should already come included, however if your install is broken, run the following command(s):

```
$ pip3 install pygame
--------------------
$ pip install pygame

Note: The standard install of python does not include 'pygame', so
the commands above are required for the game to work
```
